## Organization of the View
### _ViewImports
The `_ViewImports.cshtml` file is used to import namespaces and tag helpers that are common across multiple views in an ASP.NET Core application. This helps to avoid repetitive code in each view file.

### _ViewStart
The `_ViewStart.cshtml` file is used to set the layout for all views in the application. It allows you to define a common layout that will be applied to all views unless overridden by a specific view.

### The Shared Folder
The `Shared` folder contains views that are shared across multiple parts of the application. This typically includes layout files, partial views, and other reusable components that can be used in different views.

#### _Layout
The `_Layout.cshtml` file is a common layout file that defines the overall structure of the HTML page, including the header, footer, and main content area. It is used to provide a consistent look and feel across all pages in the application.

#### _ValidationScriptsPartial
The `_ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml` file is used to include client-side validation scripts in the layout. This ensures that validation scripts are available on pages that require them, enhancing user experience by providing immediate feedback on form inputs.

### The Pages Folder
The `Pages` folder contains Razor Pages, which are a simplified way to build web pages in ASP.NET Core. Each Razor Page consists of a `.cshtml` file for the view and an optional `.cshtml.cs` file for the page model (code-behind).

## The wwwroot Folder
The `wwwroot` folder is the web root of the application, where static files such as CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets are stored. This folder is publicly accessible and serves as the base path for static content in the application.

## The Configurations files
### appsettings.json
The `appsettings.json` file is used to store configuration settings for the application. It typically includes settings such as connection strings, logging configurations, and other application-specific settings. This file can be easily modified without changing the code, allowing for flexible configuration management.

### launchSettings.json
The `launchSettings.json` file is used to configure how the application is launched during development. It specifies settings such as the environment variables, application URL, and other parameters that affect the development experience. This file is typically used by the development server to set up the application environment when running locally.
